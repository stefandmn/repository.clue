# Clue Repository

The **Clue Repository** is the main repository of **Clue Media Experiencee** distribution, 
providing adapted addons for **Kodi**, and containing programs, services, skins, and many 
other addon types and instances, part of them being already embedded in **Clue** system. 

Development, testing and deployment activities are driven by CCM process (Clue 
Configuration Management), built over GNU `make` utility. To see all make rules
try `make help`.

_Enjoy!_
